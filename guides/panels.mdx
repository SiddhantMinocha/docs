Virtual gene panels are curated lists of genes associated with a specific disease or clinical question. Use them to focus your variant analysis on the genes that matter most.

## Why use gene panels

When a patient has thousands of variants, looking at all of them is impractical. A gene panel narrows the search to a targeted set of genes, so you can focus on variants with clinical relevance to a specific condition.

## Viewing panels

Navigate to **Panels** in the sidebar to see all available panels. You'll see:

- Panels you created
- Public panels shared by your team or organization

## Creating a panel

Click **New panel** to get started. You can configure:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Basic information" icon="circle-info">
    - **Name** — a descriptive name for the panel
    - **Description** — what condition or use case this panel covers
    - **Visibility** — whether the panel is private or public
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clinical details" icon="stethoscope">
    - **Clinical intent** — diagnostic, differential, confirmatory, carrier screening, or research
    - **Validation status** — draft, validated, or deprecated
    - **Inheritance models** — autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked, or mitochondrial
    - **Variant types** — SNV, indel, CNV, or structural variants
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Managing genes

After creating a panel, add genes to it by searching for gene symbols. You can:

- **Add genes** one at a time using the gene search
- **Remove genes** you no longer want in the panel
- **View gene details** including associated diseases and function

## Linking diseases

Associate diseases with your panel to document the clinical context. Search for diseases by name and link them to the panel.

## Using panels in analysis

There are two ways to use a panel for variant analysis:

### From the chat

Ask Nexus to find a panel and apply it:

```
Search for a cardiomyopathy panel and show me matching variants in this patient.
```

Nexus searches your accessible panels, finds matching ones, and uses the gene list to filter the patient's variants.

### From the variant table

Apply a panel as a filter in the variant table to restrict the display to only genes in that panel.

## Panel versioning

Nexus tracks changes to your panels over time. You can view the changelog to see when genes were added or removed, and who made the changes.

<Tip>Duplicate an existing panel to create a starting point for a new one, instead of building from scratch.</Tip>
