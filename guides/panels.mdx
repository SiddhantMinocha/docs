Gene panels let you narrow thousands of genetic variants down to a clinically relevant subset. You create a virtual panel by selecting specific genes, optionally linking disease associations, and applying clinical context like inheritance patterns and phenotype.

## Why use panels

Genomic datasets contain tens of thousands of variants per sample. Without focus, you spend time reviewing variants unrelated to your clinical question. Panels solve this by letting you define a curated gene list—diagnostic panels for known conditions, differential diagnosis panels to explore multiple hypotheses, carrier screening panels for recessive disorders, or research panels for hypothesis-driven studies.

## Viewing existing panels

Navigate to the **Variants** tab and look for the **Virtual Panels** filter. You can search your existing panels by name or description. Panels you create are listed here along with any shared with you.

## Creating a new panel

Click **New panel** to start. You'll configure several sections:

### Basic information

Give your panel a **Name** and optional **Description**. Set the **Visibility** to either:
- **Private**: only you can access it
- **Public**: shareable with your team

### Clinical details

Specify the clinical context to help Nexus understand how you'll use this panel:

- **Clinical intent**: Choose from diagnostic (confirming a suspected condition), differential diagnosis (exploring multiple possibilities), confirmatory (validating a prior finding), carrier screening (identifying heterozygous individuals), or research (hypothesis-driven investigation)
- **Validation status**: Mark as draft (in development), validated (ready for clinical use), or deprecated (no longer recommended)
- **Inheritance models**: Select applicable patterns: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked, or mitochondrial
- **Variant types**: Include SNVs (single nucleotide variants), indels (insertions/deletions), CNVs (copy number variants), or structural variants

## Managing genes

Search for genes by symbol and add them to your panel. You'll see gene details like transcript count and disease associations. Remove genes anytime by clicking the trash icon next to each entry.

## Linking diseases

Associate diseases with your panel by searching disease names. This helps document the clinical phenotype your panel targets and improves Nexus's ability to contextualize variants.

## Using your panel

You can apply panels in two ways:

**From chat**: Ask Nexus directly—for example, "Find loss-of-function variants in my cardiomyopathy panel." Nexus retrieves and filters variants accordingly.

**From the variant browser**: Open the **Virtual Panels** filter in the **Variants** tab and select your panel. Nexus filters the current dataset to show only variants in those genes.

## Panel versioning

Your panel maintains a changelog showing when genes were added or removed and who made the change. This audit trail is useful for tracking panel evolution and understanding clinical decisions over time.

<Tip>
Duplicate an existing panel to quickly create variations—for instance, a narrow diagnostic panel and a broader differential panel for the same condition.
