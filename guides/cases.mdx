Cases are your workspace for managing patient genetic data, analyzing variants, and tracking clinical findings. Each case contains genetic variants from VCF files and provides six tabs for structured analysis.

## Viewing your cases

Switch to **Case Mode** using the toggle in the top-right corner to see all your patient cases. Cases are sorted by recent activity. Use the search bar to find a specific case by name, or browse cases in the sidebar.

## Creating a case

Click **+ New Case** to open the case creation dialog.

### Case details

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Case Name** (required) | Identifier for the case (e.g., "Patient_12345") |
| **Case Type** | Single Inherited Disease (Family and Somatic coming soon) |
| **Consanguinity** | Yes, No, or Unknown |
| **Sex** | Unknown, Male, or Female |
| **Date of Birth** | Patient DOB for age-related context |
| **Ethnicity** | Patient ethnicity for allele frequency interpretation |
| **Secondary Findings** | Opt-in or Opt-out for incidental findings in medically actionable genes |

### Sample information

Provide order number, collection and received dates, specimen type (Whole Blood, Saliva, Tissue, Buccal Swab), ordering physician, and ordering institution.

### Case variants

Upload a VCF (Variant Call Format) file by dragging and dropping onto the upload area or clicking **Upload VCF**. Nexus processes the variants and makes them available for analysis across all case tabs.

<Note>
**Patient privacy is critical.** Never include identifying information such as patient names, medical record numbers, or contact details when sharing cases or posting comments.
</Note>

## Case tabs

Once a case is open, navigate between six tabs:

| Tab | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Overview** | Dashboard with charts and summary statistics |
| **Findings** | Curated variants of interest |
| **Phenotypes** | HPO phenotype management |
| **Variants** | Full variant browser with filters |
| **Access** | Team permissions and sharing |
| **Settings** | Case configuration, files, and audit log |

For detailed documentation on each tab, see:
- [Case overview](/guides/case-overview)
- [Findings](/guides/findings)
- [Phenotypes](/guides/phenotypes)
- [Variant analysis](/guides/variant-analysis)
- [Case settings](/guides/case-settings)

## Access tab

The Access tab controls who can view and edit your case.

**Add Team Member** — Search and add team members who need access to the case.

**Members** — Lists current members with their role (Admin or General) and the date access was granted. Use the role dropdown to change permissions or the three-dot menu for additional options.

**Activity** — Shows the access change history for audit purposes.

## Asking questions about a case

From Agent Mode, use the **Cases** dropdown at the bottom of the chat input to select a case. Once selected, Nexus scopes all queries to that patient's data.

Example queries:
- "What are the likely pathogenic variants in this case?"
- "Do any variants match the patient's phenotypes?"
- "Summarize the most significant findings"
- "Find variants in the cardiac gene panel with high in silico scores"

## Case data loading

Cases load their data on demand. If you haven't accessed a case recently, Nexus retrieves the data when you open it. A loading indicator appears during retrieval.
