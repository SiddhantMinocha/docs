Cases are how you organize patient or sample data in Nexus. Each case contains a set of genetic variants and associated clinical information.

## Viewing your cases

Navigate to **Cases** in the sidebar to see all your cases. Each case shows key information at a glance, including the case name and current status.

## Creating a case

Click **New case** to create one. You'll provide:

- A name for the case
- Any relevant clinical details

Once created, variants can be loaded into the case for analysis.

## Working with a case

Select a case from the sidebar to make it active. When a case is active:

- The chat gains access to that patient's variant data
- You can use the variant table to browse and filter results
- AI tools like variant search and analytics work within that case's data

### Variant table

The variant table provides a detailed view of all variants in a case. You can:

- **Filter** by gene, pathogenicity, zygosity, consequence type, and allele frequency
- **Sort** columns to find what matters most
- **Resize** columns by dragging their edges
- **Select** multiple variants for batch actions

<Tip>Use the filters panel on the left side of the variant table to narrow down results quickly.</Tip>

### Findings

As you review variants, you can mark specific variants as **findings** — variants of interest that you want to track. Findings can include clinical notes to capture your interpretation.

## Case data loading

Nexus uses a storage system that keeps your active cases ready for fast querying. If a case hasn't been accessed recently, it may take a moment to load when you first open it. You'll see a loading indicator while the data prepares.

<Note>Cases that haven't been accessed in a while are automatically archived for storage efficiency. They reload on demand when you open them.</Note>

## Asking questions about a case

Once a case is selected, you can return to the chat and ask questions about the patient's data:

- "Show me all pathogenic variants"
- "Are there any variants in RAS pathway genes?"
- "Create a chart of variant consequences"
- "Summarize the key findings"

Nexus automatically scopes its search to the active case.
