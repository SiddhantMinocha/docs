The Overview tab provides a dashboard view of your case with charts and summary statistics at a glance. Navigate to it by clicking the **Overview** tab after opening a case.

## Pathogenicity distribution

A donut chart displays the breakdown of your variants by pathogenicity classification. The chart shows the total variant count at the center and segments for each category:

- **Pathogenic** (red)
- **Likely Pathogenic** (orange)
- **VUS** — Variants of Uncertain Significance (yellow)
- **Likely Benign** (light green)
- **Benign** (green)

Hover over any segment to see the exact count and percentage.

## Variant location

A donut chart shows the genomic distribution of your variants across different regions — exonic, intronic, intergenic, UTR, and splice site regions. This helps you understand where in the genome your variants are concentrated.

## Read depth distribution

A bar chart visualizes the sequencing coverage depth across your sample. The x-axis shows depth ranges and the y-axis shows the number of variants at each depth. This helps identify whether your data has sufficient coverage for confident variant calling.

## Case information

A summary card displays key case metadata:

- **Case type** (e.g., "Single Inherited Disease")
- **Patient demographics** (sex, ethnicity, date of birth)
- **Sample information** (specimen type, collection date)

## Findings summary

A summary section shows the count of curated findings organized by category:

| Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Primary** | Variants directly related to the patient's presenting phenotype |
| **Causal** | Variants confirmed as causing the patient's condition |
| **Secondary** | Variants related to the case but not the primary explanation |
| **Incidental** | Variants in medically actionable genes discovered during analysis |

Click any category count to navigate directly to the [Findings](/guides/findings) tab filtered to that category.

<Tip>
Use the Overview tab as your starting point when opening a case. The charts give you an immediate sense of the variant landscape before diving into detailed analysis.
