The chat is the primary way you interact with Nexus. You type questions or instructions in plain language, and Nexus responds with answers, data tables, charts, or documents.

## Starting a conversation

Click **New chat** in the sidebar to begin. Each conversation gets its own thread, so you can have multiple analyses going at once.

Your conversation history is saved automatically and accessible from the sidebar at any time.

## What you can ask

Nexus understands a wide range of genomics-related questions. Here are some examples:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Variant queries" icon="dna">
    When you have a case selected, you can ask about patient variants:

    - "Show me all pathogenic variants in this case"
    - "Are there any BRCA1 or BRCA2 variants?"
    - "List homozygous variants with allele frequency below 1%"
    - "How many missense variants are in this patient?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Gene and disease lookups" icon="book-medical">
    Ask about genes, diseases, or clinical significance:

    - "What is the function of the TP53 gene?"
    - "Find ClinVar entries for CFTR"
    - "Search PubMed for recent studies on Lynch syndrome"
    - "What OMIM entries exist for Marfan syndrome?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Analysis and visualization" icon="chart-bar">
    Request aggregations, statistics, or charts:

    - "Show me the distribution of variant consequences"
    - "Create a pie chart of pathogenicity classifications"
    - "What's the breakdown of zygosity across all variants?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reports and documents" icon="file-lines">
    Ask Nexus to create documents:

    - "Write a summary of the pathogenic findings in this case"
    - "Create a report of all high-impact variants"
    - "Generate a Python script to analyze this variant data"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Working with case context

When you select a case from the sidebar, Nexus gains access to that patient's variant data. This means your questions can reference the patient directly:

```
What are the most clinically significant variants in this patient?
```

Without a case selected, Nexus can still answer general genomics questions and search public databases.

<Note>You can switch cases at any time. Nexus updates its context automatically.</Note>

## Chat history

All conversations are saved and listed in the sidebar. You can:

- Click any past conversation to resume it
- Delete conversations you no longer need
- Start a new chat at any time without losing previous work

## Artifacts

During a conversation, Nexus may create **artifacts** — documents that appear in a side panel next to the chat. These can be text reports, code scripts, or data tables.

Artifacts are versioned. If you ask Nexus to revise a document, you can compare versions and revert if needed.

## Feedback

You can upvote or downvote any message from Nexus. This helps improve response quality over time.
