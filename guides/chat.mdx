The chat interface is the primary way you interact with Purna. Ask questions in natural language and receive evidence-based answers with citations from genomic databases.

## Starting a conversation

Click the **+** button in the top bar to start a new chat. The home screen displays suggested prompts to get you started, such as "Find pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes."

Click any suggestion or type your own question directly into the chat input.

<Tip>
Start with specific, focused questions about variants, genes, or diseases to get the most relevant results.
</Tip>

## Switching between Agent Mode and Case Mode

Toggle buttons in the top-right corner switch between **Agent Mode** and **Case Mode**.

**Agent Mode** is a chat-first experience for general genomics queries. No patient context is needed — use it to research genes, diseases, variants, and clinical implications.

**Case Mode** opens the case management view and displays your patient cases. Switch between modes at any time depending on your workflow.

## Working with patient case context

To analyze data from a specific patient, use the **Cases** dropdown at the bottom of the chat input. Select a patient case and Purna scopes its queries to that patient's variant data.

Once a case is selected, you can ask questions like:
- "What are the likely pathogenic variants in this case?"
- "Find loss-of-function variants in BRCA1"
- "Are there any ClinVar pathogenic variants in the cardiac gene panel?"

<Note>
Without a case selected, Purna answers general genomics questions and searches public databases but cannot access patient-specific variant data.
</Note>

## Selecting research sources

Control which databases Purna searches using the **Sources** dropdown next to the Cases dropdown. The counter (e.g., "5/5") shows how many source categories are active.

Click **Sources** to open the panel with five toggleable categories:

| Category | Databases |
|----------|-----------|
| **Research Papers** | PubMed, Nature, Cell, NEJM, Lancet, arXiv, bioRxiv |
| **Clinical Evidence** | ClinVar, ClinicalTrials, OMIM, ClinGen, Orphanet |
| **Variant Databases** | gnomAD, GWAS Catalog, dbSNP, VarSome, Franklin |
| **Guidelines** | ACMG, NCCN, UpToDate, CDC, WHO |
| **Drugs & Therapies** | PharmGKB, DrugBank, FDA, ClinicalTrials |

Toggle categories on or off to focus results on specific types of evidence.

<Tip>
For clinical variant analysis, "Clinical Evidence" and "Variant Databases" are often most relevant. For drug interactions, focus on "Drugs & Therapies."
</Tip>

## Types of questions you can ask

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Variant queries" icon="dna">
    With a case selected, ask about specific variants — classification, pathogenicity, clinical significance, allele frequencies, and functional impacts. Example: "What is the clinical significance of CFTR c.1521_1523delCTT?"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Gene and disease lookups" icon="book-medical">
    Research genes and their associated diseases, clinical significance, and known variants. Example: "What genes are associated with cardiomyopathy?"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Analysis and visualization" icon="chart-bar">
    Request aggregations, statistics, and charts from your data. Example: "Create a bar chart of variants per gene in my case."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reports and documents" icon="file-lines">
    Generate clinical reports, variant summaries, and other structured documents. Example: "Generate a variant interpretation report for the pathogenic findings."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## AI tool usage indicators

When Purna uses a tool to query a database, a status indicator appears above the response showing which tool was used and the result count:

- "Variant Annotation — Found 20 variants"
- "PubMed — Found 15 papers"
- "MyGene.info — Found gene information"

A green checkmark indicates successful tool usage.

## Citations and references

Responses include inline citation badges linking to original sources. Badges are color-coded by database — click any badge to open the source record in a new tab and verify the information.

<Note>
Always verify clinical findings by clicking citation badges to review the original source data.
</Note>

## Managing chat history

The sidebar displays past conversations organized by **Today**, **Yesterday**, and **Last 7 days**. Use the search bar at the top to find conversations by keyword.

Click any conversation to resume it. Hover over a conversation to reveal a three-dot menu with options to rename or delete it. Use the trash icon in the top bar to manage multiple chats.

## Chat visibility

The lock icon with a dropdown arrow in the top bar controls conversation visibility. Click it to toggle between private and shared visibility for your current conversation.

<Tip>
Keep conversations private by default to protect patient data and confidential analysis.
</Tip>

## Attaching files

Click the paperclip icon next to the send button to attach files to your message. You can share genomic files, documents, or other relevant data for Purna to analyze.

## Providing feedback

Each response includes feedback options:
- **Copy**: Copy the response text to your clipboard
- **Thumbs up**: Mark the response as helpful
- **Thumbs down**: Mark the response as unhelpful

## Working with artifacts

During conversations, Purna may create artifacts — documents, code files, or spreadsheets — that appear in a side panel alongside your chat. Artifacts are versioned with built-in change tracking.

You can generate three types of artifacts:
- **Text documents**: Clinical summaries, variant reports, case notes
- **Code files**: Reusable Python scripts
- **Spreadsheets**: Tabular data in CSV format

Each artifact maintains version history, and you can download artifacts or reference them later in the conversation.

<Tip>
Use artifacts to generate reports, scripts, and datasets that you can download or export for external use.
