The Phenotypes tab lets you manage HPO (Human Phenotype Ontology) terms that describe the patient's clinical presentation. Phenotypes drive variant filtering and help Purna prioritize clinically relevant variants.

## Adding phenotypes

Two methods are available for adding phenotypes to your case:

### AI Assist

Click the **AI Assist** tab and provide a clinical description of the patient's symptoms. Purna suggests relevant HPO terms based on your description. Review the suggestions and add the ones that apply.

### Manual search

Click the **Search** tab and type a phenotype name or HPO identifier (e.g., "HP:0001250" for Seizure). Browse results and click to add phenotypes to your case.

## Managing phenotypes

Added phenotypes appear as cards showing the phenotype name and HPO ID. Remove a phenotype by clicking the **X** on its card.

## Using phenotypes as variant filters

Phenotypes become powerful filtering tools in the [Variants tab](/guides/variant-analysis):

- **Primary Phenotypes** — Toggle "Use case phenotypes" in the filter panel to automatically filter variants by your case's HPO terms. Active phenotypes display as removable chips.
- **Secondary Phenotypes** — Apply additional phenotype-based filtering beyond primary phenotypes for more granular analysis.

<Tip>
Use **AI Assist** to quickly populate phenotypes from a clinical summary, then refine the list manually. Phenotype-driven filtering is one of the most effective ways to prioritize clinically relevant variants.
