The Findings tab displays variants you've marked as clinically significant during your analysis. These curated findings form the basis of your clinical interpretation and reporting.

## Finding categories

Filter findings using the category tabs at the top:

| Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **All** | View all findings regardless of category |
| **Primary** | Variant most likely explains the patient's phenotype |
| **Causal** | Confirmed to cause the patient's condition |
| **Secondary** | Related but not the primary cause |
| **Incidental** | Clinically significant variant unrelated to the case phenotype |

## Finding cards

Each finding displays as a card with the following information:

- **Gene symbol** — The gene where the variant occurs
- **Genomic position** — Chromosome and coordinate (e.g., "chr17:43,091,578")
- **Pathogenicity badge** — Color-coded classification (Pathogenic, Likely Pathogenic, VUS, etc.)
- **HGVS notation** — Standardized variant description
- **Zygosity** — Heterozygous or Homozygous
- **Consequence type** — Predicted functional impact (missense, frameshift, splice site, etc.)
- **Reviewer** — Who marked this finding

Each card includes two action buttons:
- **Details** — Opens the [variant detail panel](/guides/variant-detail) for comprehensive information
- **Edit Notes** — Add or modify clinical notes for the finding

## Marking a finding

To mark a variant as a finding:

1. Open the [Variants tab](/guides/variant-analysis) and locate the variant
2. Click on the variant to open the detail panel
3. Use the marking controls to designate it as a finding and select a category

## Exporting findings

Click the **Export** button at the top of the Findings tab to download your curated findings. The export includes all finding metadata for use in clinical reports or external documentation.

<Note>
Findings can be included in [clinical reports](/guides/clinical-reports) generated from the chat interface.
