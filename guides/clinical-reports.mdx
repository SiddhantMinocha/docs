Purna generates structured clinical reports from your analysis data. Ask for a report from the chat interface and Purna creates a comprehensive document based on your case data, findings, and variant analysis.

## Report types

Five report types are available:

| Report Type | What it includes |
| --- | --- |
| **Variant interpretation** | Detailed interpretation of specific variants with evidence from ClinVar, literature, and in silico predictions |
| **Clinical findings** | Summary of all curated findings with pathogenicity classifications and clinical significance |
| **Case summary** | Overview of the entire case including patient information, variant statistics, and key findings |
| **ACMG evidence** | ACMG/AMP criteria evaluation for selected variants with evidence citations |
| **Variant comparison** | Side-by-side comparison of multiple variants across key metrics |

## Generating a report

Ask Purna to create a report from the chat interface with a case selected:

```
"Generate a variant interpretation report for the BRCA1 pathogenic variant"
"Create a case summary report"
"Write a clinical findings report for all primary findings"
"Generate an ACMG evidence report for the variants I've flagged"
```

Purna gathers the relevant data from your case and produces a structured document in the artifacts panel.

## Report structure

Reports include:

- **Headings and sections** — Organized by topic for easy navigation
- **Tables** — Variant data, allele frequencies, and classification summaries
- **Callout sections** — Highlighted warnings, notes, and clinical recommendations
- **Charts** — Visual summaries of variant distributions or comparison data
- **Citations** — References to ClinVar, PubMed, and other sources

## Viewing and exporting

Reports appear as artifacts in the side panel alongside your chat. You can:

- **Review** the full report content within Purna
- **Download** the report for external use
- **Reference** the report in subsequent conversations
- **Track versions** as the report evolves through your analysis

<Note>
Clinical reports are generated based on the data available in your case at the time of generation. Update your findings and ACMG classifications before generating final reports to ensure accuracy.
