Purna supports ACMG/AMP variant classification with 28 standard criteria. The ACMG tab in the [variant detail panel](/guides/variant-detail) displays active criteria, evidence summaries, and tools for both AI-enhanced and manual classification.

## ACMG criteria overview

The ACMG/AMP framework uses 28 criteria to classify variants across five categories:

| Classification | Criteria prefix | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Pathogenic** | PVS, PS | Very strong and strong evidence of pathogenicity |
| **Likely Pathogenic** | PM | Moderate evidence of pathogenicity |
| **Supporting** | PP, BP | Supporting evidence for or against pathogenicity |
| **Likely Benign** | BS | Strong evidence of benign impact |
| **Benign** | BA | Stand-alone evidence of benign impact |

## Viewing ACMG criteria

Open the ACMG tab in the variant detail panel to see:

- **Classification badge** — The current overall classification (Pathogenic, Likely Pathogenic, VUS, Likely Benign, or Benign)
- **Active criteria** — Each criterion that applies to this variant, shown as a labeled badge (e.g., "BA1", "BS1", "BP7")
- **Evidence summaries** — Brief descriptions of why each criterion was applied
- **Computational evidence** — Aggregated results from SIFT, PolyPhen-2, AlphaMissense, and CADD

Each criterion badge indicates whether it was determined by computational analysis (**DET**) or by AI review (**AI**).

## AI-enhanced classification

Click the **AI Enhance** button to trigger an AI-powered evaluation of ACMG criteria. This is a three-step workflow:

### Step 1: Start

Click **AI Enhance** to begin. Purna initiates the analysis and begins gathering evidence.

### Step 2: Running

Purna evaluates the variant against ACMG criteria using evidence from multiple sources:

- **ClinVar** — Clinical significance submissions and review status
- **PubMed** — Published literature on the variant and gene
- **gnomAD** — Population allele frequency data
- **Functional data** — In silico predictions and conservation scores
- **Phen2Gene** — Phenotype-gene association ranking

A progress indicator shows which evidence sources are being queried.

### Step 3: Results

The AI presents its findings:

- **Suggested criteria** — ACMG criteria the AI recommends adding or modifying
- **Confidence scores** — How confident the AI is in each suggestion
- **Evidence citations** — Sources supporting each criterion
- **DET vs AI badges** — Distinguishing computational determinations from AI-suggested criteria

Review each suggestion and choose to **accept** or **reject** individual criteria. Accepted criteria update the variant's ACMG classification.

<Note>
AI-enhanced classification is a decision-support tool. Always review the evidence and apply your clinical judgment before accepting AI suggestions.

## Manual reclassification

Click the **Reclassify** button to manually update a variant's classification:

1. Select the new classification from the dropdown (Pathogenic, Likely Pathogenic, VUS, Likely Benign, or Benign)
2. Add criteria that support your reclassification
3. Provide a justification note explaining your reasoning
4. Click **Save** to apply the reclassification

### Reclassification history

Every reclassification is recorded in the variant's history. The history shows:

- **Date** of each reclassification
- **Previous classification** and **new classification**
- **Who** made the change
- **Justification** provided

You can revert to a previous classification if needed.

<Tip>
Document your reasoning when reclassifying variants. The reclassification history creates an audit trail that supports reproducible interpretation and peer review.
