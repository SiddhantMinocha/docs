Nexus can create visual representations of your data and run custom Python code — all from the chat.

## Charts

Ask Nexus to visualize your data, and it generates interactive charts directly in the conversation.

### Supported chart types

| Type | Best for |
| --- | --- |
| **Pie / Donut** | Showing proportions (e.g., pathogenicity distribution) |
| **Bar** | Comparing categories (e.g., variants per gene) |
| **Horizontal bar** | Long category labels or ranked lists |
| **Line** | Trends over ordered data |
| **Area** | Volume or cumulative distributions |

### Example prompts

```
Create a pie chart showing the pathogenicity distribution for this patient.
```

```
Show me a bar chart of the top 10 genes by variant count.
```

```
Make a donut chart of variant consequence types.
```

<Tip>You can ask Nexus to adjust colors, labels, or chart type after it generates the initial visualization.</Tip>

## Code execution

For analyses that go beyond built-in tools, Nexus can write and execute Python code with access to common data science libraries.

### Available libraries

- **pandas** — data manipulation and analysis
- **matplotlib** — plotting and visualization
- **seaborn** — statistical data visualization

### Example prompts

```
Write a Python script to calculate the transition/transversion ratio for this variant set.
```

```
Create a matplotlib heatmap showing variant density across chromosomes.
```

Nexus writes the code, runs it, and displays the results (including plots) directly in the chat.

### How it works

Code runs securely in your browser using Pyodide, a Python runtime for the web. Your data doesn't leave your session.

<Note>Code execution is best for custom analyses that aren't covered by the built-in chart and analytics tools. For standard queries, natural language is usually faster.</Note>

## Documents

Nexus can create longer-form artifacts during a conversation:

- **Text documents** — clinical summaries, variant reports, or research notes
- **Code files** — reusable Python scripts
- **Spreadsheets** — tabular data in CSV format

These appear in a side panel and are saved with version history, so you can track changes and revert if needed.
