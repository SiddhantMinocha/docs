Purna generates interactive charts embedded directly in your conversation. Ask for a visualization and Purna creates it inline — no code, no setup, no external tools.

## How it works

With a patient case selected, ask Purna to visualize your data. It queries the relevant variants, aggregates the results, and renders an interactive chart right in the chat.

Without a case selected, Purna can still generate charts from data you provide or from public database queries.

## Supported chart types

| Chart Type | Best For | Example Use |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Pie / Donut** | Proportions and percentages | Pathogenicity distribution across variants |
| **Bar** | Comparing categories | Number of variants per gene or functional class |
| **Horizontal bar** | Long labels and rankings | Genes ranked by variant count |
| **Line** | Trends over time or sequence | Coverage depth across chromosomal regions |
| **Area** | Volume and cumulative totals | Cumulative variant count by discovery date |

## Example prompts

```
"Create a bar chart showing variants per gene in my panel"
"Visualize the breakdown of pathogenic vs benign variants"
"Show me a pie chart of variants by variant type"
"Make a line graph of VAF across samples"
"Show a donut chart of zygosity distribution"
```

## Adjusting charts

After Purna generates a chart, you can ask it to modify the output in the same conversation:

- Change the chart type: *"Make this a horizontal bar chart instead"*
- Update colors: *"Use a red color scheme"*
- Add or remove data: *"Include VUS variants too"*
- Change labels or titles: *"Rename the x-axis to Gene Symbol"*

<Tip>
For standard visualizations like variant distributions and gene-level summaries, inline charts are the fastest option. For custom or complex analyses — heatmaps, multi-panel figures, statistical plots — use [Code Execution](/code-execution) instead.
