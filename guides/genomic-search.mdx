Nexus connects to major genomic databases so you can look up genes, variants, diseases, and literature without leaving the conversation.

## Supported databases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Gene databases" icon="dna">
    Search for gene information, function, and annotations.

    **Example queries:**
    - "What is the function of BRCA1?"
    - "Give me details on the TP53 gene"
    - "What pathways involve EGFR?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="ClinVar" icon="flask">
    Look up clinical significance of specific variants.

    **Example queries:**
    - "Search ClinVar for CFTR variants"
    - "Is there a ClinVar entry for this BRCA2 variant?"
    - "What pathogenic variants are reported in MLH1?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="OMIM" icon="book-medical">
    Find disease-gene associations and inheritance patterns.

    **Example queries:**
    - "What OMIM entries exist for Marfan syndrome?"
    - "Which genes are linked to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in OMIM?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SNP database" icon="circle-nodes">
    Look up SNP identifiers and variant details.

    **Example queries:**
    - "What is rs1800497?"
    - "Give me information about this dbSNP entry"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="PubMed" icon="newspaper">
    Search for published literature and research articles.

    **Example queries:**
    - "Find recent papers on CRISPR gene editing in oncology"
    - "Search PubMed for Lynch syndrome screening guidelines"
    - "What studies discuss PALB2 and breast cancer risk?"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How it works

You don't need to specify which database to search. Describe what you're looking for, and Nexus determines the right database to query:

```
Tell me about the clinical significance of BRCA1 and any recent PubMed studies.
```

Nexus may query multiple databases in a single response to give you a complete picture.

## Citations

When Nexus returns information from a database, it includes references so you can verify the source. Look for database identifiers (gene IDs, ClinVar accession numbers, PubMed IDs) in the response.

## Web search

For information not covered by genomic databases, Nexus can also search the web:

```
What are the latest ACMG guidelines for variant classification?
```

<Note>Web search results are for reference only. Always verify clinical information against authoritative sources.</Note>
