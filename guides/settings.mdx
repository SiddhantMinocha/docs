## Usage

Track your resource consumption to understand how you're using Nexus and whether you're approaching plan limits.

Toggle between **Organisation** and **Personal** views. Use the month dropdown to review historical usage patterns.

### Usage metrics

Four metric cards show current consumption against your plan limits:

| Metric | Example |
| --- | --- |
| **Queries today** | 4 / 100 / day |
| **Tokens** | 1.4M / 100.0M |
| **Cases** | 1 / 100 |
| **Compute** | 0 / 720.0K credits |

Each card includes a progress bar visualizing consumption relative to your limit.

### Daily breakdown

A table displays day-by-day token consumption for the selected month, helping you identify usage patterns and peak days.
