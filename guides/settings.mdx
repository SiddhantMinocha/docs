## General

Configure your personal information, credentials, and how the AI assistant communicates with you.

### Profile

You can update your core account information in this section:

- **Email** - Your account email address
- **Name** - Your display name visible to team members
- **Phone Number** - Your contact number
- **Medical License** - Your medical license number (if applicable)
- **Profession** - A dropdown menu with professional role options including Clinical Geneticist and other specialized roles

### Personalization

You can shape how the Nexus AI assistant responds to you by adjusting these settings. The platform learns your preferences and applies them across all your conversations:

- **Base Style** - Controls the level of detail in responses. Choose from options like Detailed (comprehensive explanations) or Concise (brief, focused answers) depending on your workflow.
- **Tone** - Defines the voice and manner of responses. Options include Professional (formal and structured) and Casual (conversational and friendly).
- **Characteristics** - Determines how cautious or confident the AI should be in its responses. Select from Balanced (measured approach), Cautious (prioritizes safety), or Confident (emphasizes certainty).
- **Output Format** - Specifies the structure of responses. Choose between Structured (organized sections and lists) or Conversational (natural, flowing dialogue).

Once you've adjusted your personalization settings, click **Save Changes** to apply your updates.

## Usage

Track your resource consumption across the platform to understand how you're using Nexus and whether you're approaching your plan limits.

You can toggle between **Organisation** and **Personal** views to see either your team's aggregate usage or your individual usage. Use the month dropdown to select a specific month (for example, "Feb 2026") to review historical usage patterns. The current plan name displays at the top of this section.

### Usage metrics

Four metric cards show your current consumption against your plan limits:

- **Queries today** - Displays your daily query count versus your daily limit (for example, 4 / 100 / day)
- **Tokens** - Shows your monthly token usage versus your monthly limit (for example, 1.4M / 100.0M)
- **Cases** - Indicates active cases versus your case limit (for example, 1 / 100)
- **Compute** - Shows compute credits used versus your credit limit (for example, 0 / 720.0K credits)

Each card includes a progress bar that visualizes your consumption relative to your limit.

### Daily breakdown

A table displays your day-by-day token consumption for the selected month. Each row shows the date and the number of tokens used that day (for example, "Feb 12 — 70,715 tokens"), helping you identify usage patterns and peak days.

## Plan

View your current subscription plan and explore other available plans that may better suit your needs.

The **Current Plan** banner at the top displays your plan name and status badge (for example, "Custom (Siddhant) - active"), giving you a quick overview of your current subscription.

### Available plans

Each plan card displays a **Select** button if you want to upgrade, or a **Downgrade** button if you're viewing a lower-tier plan than your current one.
