Access your settings by clicking **Settings** in the sidebar. Here you can manage your account preferences and configure how Nexus works for you.

## Account

Manage your account details, including your name and email address.

## Chat preferences

Configure defaults for how the chat behaves, including conversation visibility settings:

- **Private** — only you can see the conversation
- **Public** — the conversation is visible to your team

## Memory

Nexus can remember context from previous conversations to give you more personalized responses. When memory is enabled:

- Nexus recalls your preferences and past analyses
- Responses are tailored to your workflow
- You can ask Nexus to forget specific information at any time

<Note>Memory is optional and can be disabled at any time from the settings page.</Note>
