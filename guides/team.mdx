Manage your organization and administer team members from **Settings > Team**. Control who can access your organization's cases and collaborate on the Nexus platform.

## Team overview

The top of the Team section displays your organization name and current member count (e.g., "Purna Biotech Lifesciences Pvt Ltd - 2 members").

## Team members table

A table lists all members of your organization:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Member** | Name and email address |
| **Role** | Owner (crown icon) or Member (person icon) |
| **Joined date** | When the member joined your organization |

Each row includes a three-dot menu with additional options. The organization owner's row does not have additional options.

## Roles

| Role | Permissions |
| --- | --- |
| **Owner** | Full control over the organization — manage members, billing, and all settings |
| **Member** | Access to cases shared with them, ability to create and manage their own cases |

## Inviting members

Click the **Invite** button to generate an invitation link. Share this link with new team members. When they open the link, they'll be guided through the join flow.

### Joining a team

When someone receives an invitation link (`/join?code=...`):

1. They open the link in their browser
2. If they don't have a Nexus account, they create one
3. They accept the invitation to join your organization
4. They appear in your team members table

## Organization billing

At the bottom of the Team section, manage billing details for your team account. Click **Edit** to configure your billing address and update payment information.

<Note>
Team plan features (unlimited queries, SSO, custom branding, unlimited members) are available on the Team tier. See [Plans](/guides/settings#plan) for details.
