Click any variant in the [variant browser](/guides/variant-analysis) to open the variant detail panel on the right side of the screen. This panel provides seven tabs of in-depth information for thorough variant analysis.

## Assessment tab

The Assessment tab displays computational pathogenicity predictions:

### Pathogenicity predictor

A summary section shows the overall classification (e.g., "Benign" or "Pathogenic") with a visual indicator on the benign-to-pathogenic spectrum.

### In silico predictions

| Predictor | What it measures |
| --- | --- |
| **SIFT** | Whether an amino acid substitution affects protein function. Scores range from 0 (damaging) to 1 (tolerated). |
| **PolyPhen-2** | Probability that a missense mutation is damaging. Scores range from 0 (benign) to 1 (probably damaging). |
| **AlphaMissense** | Deep learning-based pathogenicity prediction. Classifies variants as Likely Benign, Ambiguous, or Likely Pathogenic. |

### Additional scores

- **CADD** (Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion) — Integrative score ranking variant deleteriousness
- Other computational evidence as available for the variant

## Details tab

The Details tab provides comprehensive variant information:

### Genomic location
- Chromosome, position, reference allele, and alternate allele
- Cytoband location

### HGVS nomenclature
- **HGVSc** — Coding DNA notation (e.g., "NM_000492.4:c.1521_1523delCTT")
- **HGVSp** — Protein notation (e.g., "NP_000483.3:p.Phe508del")

### Population frequency
Allele frequency data from gnomAD and other population databases, broken down by population group.

### Conservation
Cross-species conservation scores indicating evolutionary constraint on the variant position.

## Research tab

The Research tab aggregates evidence from multiple sources:

### ClinVar
Clinical significance interpretations submitted to ClinVar, including review status and assertion criteria.

### PubMed
Links to relevant published literature. Click to search PubMed for papers referencing this variant or gene.

### Gene information
Gene function, associated diseases, and pathway information from gene databases.

### Phen2Gene
Phenotype-to-gene ranking data showing how strongly this gene associates with the case's phenotypes.

## ACMG tab

The ACMG tab displays the variant's ACMG/AMP classification criteria. For full details, see the dedicated [ACMG classification](/guides/acmg) guide.

Key features:
- **Classification badge** — Current ACMG classification (Pathogenic, Likely Pathogenic, VUS, Likely Benign, Benign)
- **Active criteria** — ACMG criteria that apply to this variant (e.g., BA1, BS1, BP7) with evidence summaries
- **Computational evidence summary** — Aggregated computational prediction results
- **AI Enhance** button — Trigger AI-powered evidence review
- **Reclassify** button — Manually reclassify the variant

## gnomAD tab

The gnomAD tab embeds the gnomAD browser directly within the variant detail panel. View population frequency data across global populations without leaving Nexus.

The embedded browser shows:
- Allele count, allele number, and allele frequency
- Population-specific frequencies
- Variant quality metrics

## AI Analysis tab

The AI Analysis tab provides AI-powered variant interpretation. Click **Generate Analysis** to have Nexus analyze the variant using all available evidence — ClinVar data, population frequencies, in silico predictions, and published literature.

The generated analysis includes:
- Summary of clinical significance
- Evidence evaluation
- Interpretation in the context of the patient's phenotype
- Recommendations for further investigation

## Notes tab

The Notes tab lets you add collaborative notes to a variant. Notes are useful for documenting clinical reasoning, flagging variants for review, or communicating with team members.

- Click **Add Note** to create a new note
- Set note visibility (private or shared with team)
- Edit or delete existing notes
- View edit history

<Tip>
Use the Notes tab to document your clinical reasoning for each variant. This creates an audit trail that supports reproducible variant interpretation and team collaboration.
