The Settings tab in a case lets you manage case configuration, upload and manage files, review the activity audit log, and archive cases you no longer need.

## General settings

- **Case type** (Single Inherited Disease)
- **Patient demographics** (sex, ethnicity, date of birth)
- **Consanguinity status**
- **Secondary findings** opt-in/opt-out

## Files

Upload additional files related to the case — clinical notes, lab reports, imaging data, or other supporting documents.

- **Upload** — Drag and drop or browse to add files
- **Download** — Click any file to download it
- **Metadata** — View file size, upload date, and uploader name

## Settings activity

The Settings Activity section provides a chronological audit log of all changes made to the case settings. Each entry shows:

- **What changed** — The specific setting that was modified
- **Who** made the change
- **When** the change occurred
- **Previous value** and **new value**

This audit trail supports compliance requirements and team accountability.

## Danger zone

The Danger Zone section at the bottom of the Settings tab contains irreversible actions:

- **Archive case** — Remove the case from your active cases list. Archived cases can be restored later but are hidden from normal browsing.

<Note>
Archiving a case does not delete the data. The case and all its variants, findings, and files are preserved and can be restored.
