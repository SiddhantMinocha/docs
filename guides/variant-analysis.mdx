## Searching variants

With a case selected, ask Nexus to search for variants using natural language queries. This AI-powered approach lets you describe what you're looking for in plain language rather than manually navigating complex filtering options.

<Tip>
Describe what you want in plain language. Nexus understands genetic terminology and can translate your query into appropriate filters automatically. For example, ask about genes of interest, inheritance patterns, or predicted impact levels.
</Tip>

### Example variant search query

```
Find all pathogenic variants in BRCA1 that are homozygous
```

Or ask for more complex queries:

```
Show me heterozygous variants affecting mRNA in genes from the cardiac gene panel with high in silico scores
```

### Available filters

When searching variants, you can apply the following filter categories to refine your results:

| Filter | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Gene** | Filter by specific gene symbol or list of genes | PCSK9, LDLR, APOB |
| **Pathogenicity** | Filter by predicted or confirmed pathogenic status | Pathogenic, Likely Pathogenic, VUS, Benign |
| **Zygosity** | Filter by inheritance pattern in the proband | Homozygous, Heterozygous, Hemizygous |
| **Consequence** | Filter by variant effect type on transcript | Frameshift, Missense, Splice site, Intron variant |
| **Allele frequency** | Filter by population frequency thresholds | Common (>1%), Rare (<0.1%), Novel (no frequency data) |

## Using the variant browser

Navigate to a case and click the **Variants** tab in the navigation menu to access the variant browser. This interface displays all genetic variants identified in the case with comprehensive filtering and visualization options.

You can toggle between two viewing formats using the toggle button in the top-right corner:
- **Cards** view: Visual card-based layout showing one variant per card
- **Table** view: Compact tabular format for comparing multiple variants

### Filter panel

The left sidebar contains collapsible filter sections that let you refine variant results:

#### Virtual Panels
Search and apply gene panel lists to your variants. Type the name of a gene panel to search available options. When you apply a panel, the variant display automatically restricts to genes included in that panel. This is useful for analyzing variants within clinically defined gene groups.

#### Genes
Type gene symbols (such as PCSK9, BRCA1, or TP53) and press Enter to filter. You can add multiple genes to the same filter—each gene name creates a separate chip that you can remove individually.

#### Primary Phenotypes
Toggle the **Use case phenotypes** option to automatically populate phenotypes from the case's HPO (Human Phenotype Ontology) terms. Selected phenotypes appear as removable chips (for example, "Abnormal LDL cholesterol conc..." or "Hypertriglyceridemia"). Click the settings gear icon to configure which phenotypes display.

#### Secondary Phenotypes
Apply additional phenotype-based filtering beyond primary phenotypes to further narrow variant results.

#### Clear filters
Click the **Clear** button at the top of the filter panel to reset all active filters and return to the full variant list.

### Variant count stats

The top-right corner displays a stats bar showing:
- **Total variant count**: The complete number of variants in the case (for example, "74,161 total")
- **Pathogenicity breakdown**: Color-coded dots and counts for each category:
  - Red dot: Pathogenic variants
  - Yellow dot: Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS)
  - Green dot: Benign variants

### Cards view

The cards view displays one variant per card with the following information:

**Card layout:**
- **Gene symbol**: Displayed prominently in the top-left corner in large text
- **Consequence badge**: A colored label indicating the variant effect type (for example, "non coding exon variant" or "intron variant")
- **Genomic position**: Chromosome, position, and alleles in standard notation (for example, "chr19:11,086,757 G>A")
- **HGVS notation**: Transcript-level variant description

**Data fields row (left to right):**
- **Zygosity**: Heterozygous (half-filled circle) or Homozygous (filled circle) status
- **In Silico**: Functional prediction scores from computational tools
- **Depth**: Read depth coverage (for example, "26x")
- **AF (pop)**: Population allele frequency from reference databases
- **ClinVar**: Classification status from the ClinVar database
- **Inheritance**: Inheritance mode relevant to the case (for example, "Default (Recessive)")
- **rsID**: Reference SNP identifier for known variants

**Pathogenicity badge** (top-right):
- Pathogenic (red)
- Likely Pathogenic (orange)
- VUS (yellow)
- VUS/Conflicting (yellow with gray accent)
- Likely Benign (light green)
- Benign (green)

### Table view

The table view presents variants in a compact tabular format for easy comparison.

**Columns:**
- Checkbox column for selecting multiple variants
- **Gene**: Gene symbol
- **Phenotype**: Associated phenotype information
- **Zygosity**: Inheritance pattern (shown as filled or half-filled circle)
- **P.**: Pathogenicity (shown as color-coded dot)
- **C.**: Consequence type

**Customization:**
Click the **Columns** button in the table header to show or hide specific columns based on your analysis needs.

**Sorting:**
Click any column header to sort the table by that field in ascending or descending order.

## Variant analytics

Ask Nexus to aggregate and analyze variant data from chat. Nexus can process queries about:
- Variant distribution across genes, chromosomes, or consequence types
- Variant counts by pathogenicity or zygosity categories
- Top genes affected in your case
- Phenotype-variant associations

Nexus can generate visual charts from these analytics, making it easy to identify patterns and prioritize variants for investigation.

## Combining panels with variant search

You can apply gene panels together with other filters to narrow your analysis:

1. **From the filter sidebar**: Click **Virtual Panels**, search for a panel name, and apply it. Then add additional filters (gene, phenotype, pathogenicity) as needed.

2. **From chat**: Ask Nexus a combined query such as "Apply the cardiac gene panel and show me only pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants."

This combination approach is powerful for focused analysis on clinically relevant gene sets while maintaining control over variant quality and predicted impact.

## Marking findings

When you identify a variant of clinical interest during your analysis, mark it as a finding. Findings allow you to flag and document important discoveries for your case review and reporting.

### Finding categories

Each finding is assigned one of the following categories:
- **Primary**: The variant is likely to be the cause of the patient's phenotype
- **Causal**: Confirmed causal variant
- **Secondary**: Relevant but not primary cause
- **Incidental**: Clinically significant variant unrelated to the case phenotype

### Finding details

Each marked finding stores and displays the following information:
- Gene symbol
- Genomic position (chromosome:start-end)
- HGVS notation
- Pathogenicity classification
- Zygosity status
- Consequence type
- Reviewer name (who marked the finding)

### Accessing findings

Navigate to the **Findings** tab in the case to view all marked findings, review their classifications, and prepare findings for clinical reporting.

<Note>
Findings can be exported for inclusion in clinical reports and case summaries. This makes it easy to generate standardized documentation of your variant analysis conclusions.
