Nexus provides multiple ways to explore variant data — from natural language questions in the chat to detailed filters in the variant table.

## Searching variants

With a case selected, ask Nexus to search for variants using any combination of criteria:

```
Show me pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in BRCA1 with allele frequency below 0.01
```

### Available filters

You can filter variants by:

| Filter | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Gene** | One or more gene symbols | BRCA1, TP53, EGFR |
| **Pathogenicity** | Clinical classification | Pathogenic, likely pathogenic, VUS |
| **Zygosity** | Variant genotype | Homozygous, heterozygous |
| **Consequence** | Predicted effect | Missense, nonsense, frameshift, splice |
| **Allele frequency** | Population frequency threshold | Below 1%, below 0.1% |

<Tip>You don't need to remember filter names. Describe what you're looking for in plain language, and Nexus applies the right filters.</Tip>

## Variant analytics

Beyond searching, you can ask Nexus to aggregate and analyze variant data:

- "How many pathogenic variants does this patient have?"
- "What's the distribution of variant consequences?"
- "Show me the top 10 genes by variant count"

Nexus returns statistics and can generate charts to visualize the results.

## Using the variant table

The variant table in the case view gives you a hands-on way to explore variants:

- **Filters panel** — toggle filters on the left to narrow results
- **Column sorting** — click column headers to sort
- **Resizable columns** — drag column edges to adjust width
- **Batch selection** — select multiple variants for group actions

## Combining panels with variant search

For targeted analysis, apply a gene panel to restrict your search:

```
Use the hereditary cancer panel to filter this patient's variants and show only pathogenic ones.
```

This combines the panel's gene list with your pathogenicity filter to show only the most relevant results.

## Marking findings

When you identify a variant of interest, you can mark it as a **finding**. Findings are saved to the case and can include your clinical notes and interpretation.
