The Variants tab is your full variant browser. Filter variants using gene panels, phenotypes, genes, and pathogenicity criteria, then analyze results in cards or table view.

## Searching variants from chat

With a case selected, ask Purna to search for variants using natural language:

```
Find all pathogenic variants in BRCA1 that are homozygous
```

Or more complex queries:

```
Show me heterozygous variants affecting mRNA in genes from the cardiac gene panel with high in silico scores
```

<Tip>
Describe what you want in plain language. Purna translates your query into appropriate filters automatically.
</Tip>

### Available filters

| Filter | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Gene** | Filter by gene symbol or list | PCSK9, LDLR, APOB |
| **Pathogenicity** | Filter by classification | Pathogenic, Likely Pathogenic, VUS, Benign |
| **Zygosity** | Filter by inheritance pattern | Homozygous, Heterozygous, Hemizygous |
| **Consequence** | Filter by variant effect type | Frameshift, Missense, Splice site, Intron variant |
| **Allele frequency** | Filter by population frequency | Common (>1%), Rare (<0.1%), Novel |

## Variant browser

Navigate to a case and click the **Variants** tab to access the variant browser. Toggle between **Cards** and **Table** views using the toggle button in the top-right corner.

### Variant count stats

The top-right displays a stats bar showing:
- **Total variant count** (e.g., "74,161 total")
- **Pathogenicity breakdown** with color-coded dots:
  - Red: Pathogenic
  - Yellow: VUS (Variants of Uncertain Significance)
  - Green: Benign

## Filter panel

The left sidebar contains collapsible filter sections:

### Virtual Panels

Search and apply gene panel lists to your variants. Type a panel name to search available options. When applied, the variant display restricts to genes in that panel.

### Genes

Type gene symbols (e.g., "PCSK9", "BRCA1", "TP53") and press Enter to filter. Each gene creates a removable chip. Add multiple genes to the same filter.

### Primary Phenotypes

Toggle **Use case phenotypes** to automatically filter by the case's HPO terms. Active phenotypes display as removable chips. Click the settings gear icon to configure which phenotypes are active.

### Secondary Phenotypes

Apply additional phenotype-based filtering beyond primary phenotypes for more granular analysis.

Click **Clear** at the top of the filter panel to reset all filters.

## Cards view

Each variant card shows:

- **Gene symbol** — Prominently displayed in the top-left
- **Consequence badge** — Color-coded variant effect (e.g., "missense variant", "intron variant")
- **Genomic position** — Chromosome, position, and alleles (e.g., "chr19:11,086,757 G>A")
- **HGVS notation** — Transcript-level variant description

**Data fields row:**

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Zygosity** | Heterozygous (half-filled circle) or Homozygous (filled circle) |
| **In Silico** | Functional prediction scores |
| **Depth** | Read depth coverage (e.g., "26x") |
| **AF (pop)** | Population allele frequency |
| **ClinVar** | ClinVar classification |
| **Inheritance** | Inheritance mode (e.g., "Default (Recessive)") |
| **rsID** | Reference SNP identifier |

**Pathogenicity badge** in the top-right corner:
- Pathogenic (red)
- Likely Pathogenic (orange)
- VUS (yellow)
- VUS/Conflicting (yellow/gray)
- Likely Benign (light green)
- Benign (green)

Click any variant card to open the [variant detail panel](/guides/variant-detail).

## Table view

A compact tabular format for comparing multiple variants:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Checkbox | Select variants for batch operations |
| **Gene** | Gene symbol |
| **Phenotype** | Associated phenotype information |
| **Zygosity** | Filled or half-filled circle |
| **P.** | Pathogenicity (color-coded dot) |
| **C.** | Consequence type |

Click **Columns** to customize which columns are visible. Click any column header to sort.

## Variant analytics

Ask Purna to aggregate and analyze variant data from chat:

- "Show the variant distribution across genes"
- "How many pathogenic variants are in this case?"
- "Create a bar chart of variants per chromosome"

Purna generates visual charts from these analytics to help identify patterns.

## Combining panels with filters

Apply gene panels together with other filters for focused analysis:

1. **From the filter sidebar**: Select a Virtual Panel, then add gene, phenotype, or pathogenicity filters.
2. **From chat**: "Apply the cardiac gene panel and show only pathogenic variants."

<Note>
Click any variant in cards view to open the [variant detail panel](/guides/variant-detail) with seven tabs of in-depth information including ACMG classification, research data, and AI analysis.
