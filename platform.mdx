## Overview

Purna is a variant analysis and genomic interpretation platform designed for research and clinical workflows. It provides a comprehensive framework for genomic data management and analysis — enabling you to identify and classify genetic variants, annotate them with evidence from curated databases, and generate actionable insights.

The platform integrates raw genetic data with relevant patient metadata and applies validated pipelines for annotation, classification, and interpretation. It compiles publicly available datasets, laboratory-specific data, and community-curated evidence to produce comprehensive, custom genetic reports that support clinical decision-making and research activities.

<Note>
Purna is a research and clinical decision-support tool. All outputs are intended to assist qualified professionals and should be reviewed by a genetic specialist before being used in any clinical context.
</Note>

## Intended users

Purna is built for laboratories, hospitals, and organizations specializing in genetic analysis, interpretation, and reporting. The platform is designed for use by genetic specialists — including clinical geneticists, genetic counselors, molecular biologists, and bioinformaticians — with advanced expertise in genomics and variant interpretation.

## Intended population

Purna is intended for use on genomic data obtained from individuals undergoing genetic testing across a range of clinical and research contexts, including diagnostic testing, carrier screening, predictive testing, and pharmacogenomic analysis.

## Specimen types

Purna operates on processed genomic sequence data derived from human biological specimens. The platform does not handle physical samples directly. It requires sequence data (VCF files, or FastQ and BAM files for enterprise customers) that originate from specimens such as:

- Whole blood
- Cord blood
- Dried blood spots
- Saliva swabs
- Cultured fibroblasts
- Frozen tissues
- Buccal swabs
- Other biological specimens yielding extractable DNA

## Operating principles

Purna operates by processing and interpreting next-generation sequencing (NGS) data derived from human biological specimens. The platform uses validated bioinformatics pipelines to detect, annotate, and classify genetic variants.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Data ingestion">
    Upload VCF files in GRCh37 (hg19) or GRCh38 (hg38) format. The platform auto-detects the genome assembly and validates the input.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Annotation">
    Variants are annotated using Ensembl VEP with RefSeq transcripts, population frequencies from gnomAD, clinical classifications from ClinVar, and in silico predictions from SIFT, PolyPhen-2, and AlphaMissense. See the [Annotation Pipeline](/pipeline) for full technical details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Classification">
    Each variant receives an automated ACMG/AMP pathogenicity classification based on 28 standard criteria. Classifications can be refined interactively using AI-enhanced evidence gathering from multiple databases.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Interpretation and reporting">
    Annotated variants are available for querying, filtering, and analysis through the AI chat interface, variant browser, and code execution environment. Structured clinical reports can be generated on demand.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported applications

The platform is compatible with data generated from the following sequencing technologies:

| Application | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Whole Exome Sequencing (WES)** | Coding regions of the genome, typically 30,000–100,000 variants |
| **Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)** | Full genome coverage, up to 1 million variants (enterprise for larger datasets) |
| **Targeted gene panels** | Custom or curated gene sets, typically 100–5,000 variants |
| **Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA)** | Copy number variant detection from array-based platforms |

## Nature of output

Purna delivers qualitative, semi-quantitative, and quantitative outputs to support genetic data interpretation:

## Limitations

- Purna is a decision-support tool. It does not make autonomous clinical decisions and is not intended to replace the judgment of qualified genetic specialists.
- Automated ACMG/AMP classifications are rule-based starting points. All classifications should be reviewed by a trained professional before being used in a clinical setting.
- Variant annotations reflect the versions of reference databases at the time of processing. Re-annotation may be needed as databases are updated.
- The platform currently supports Single Inherited Disease case types. Family Inherited Disease and Somatic case types are coming soon.

## Security and privacy

- All data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest.
- Patient data is stored in your organization's isolated environment and is never shared across accounts.
- Access to individual cases is controlled through role-based permissions configurable in [Team settings](/guides/team).

<Note>
Never include patient-identifying information such as names, medical record numbers, or contact details in case names, notes, or shared conversations. Use anonymized identifiers for all cases.
