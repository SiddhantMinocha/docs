Get up and running with Purna in just a few minutes. You'll learn how to sign in, explore Agent Mode for genomics queries, and switch to Case Mode for patient case management.

## Sign in to Purna

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Purna">
    Navigate to **mip.purna.ai** in your web browser.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign in">
    Enter your Purna credentials. If you don't have an account, contact your organization administrator or use an [invitation link](/guides/team#joining-a-team) if one was shared with you.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View the home screen">
    After signing in, you'll see the Purna home screen in Agent Mode with suggested prompts to get started.

## Start chatting in Agent Mode

Agent Mode is your entry point to Purna. Use natural language to ask questions about genes, variants, diseases, and clinical implications.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a suggested prompt">
    The home screen offers helpful starting points. Click any suggestion to begin, such as:

    - "Find pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes"
    - "What are the clinical implications of a VUS in TP53?"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Or type your own question">
    Click in the chat input box and type your question. For example:

    - "Which genes are associated with hereditary breast cancer?"
    - "What does ClinVar say about EGFR p.Val397Met?"
  </Step>
  <Step title="View the response">
    Purna returns evidence-based answers with citations from genomic databases. Tool usage indicators show which databases were queried and how many results were found.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Purna understands genomics terminology and context, so natural language queries work best. You can ask complex, multi-part questions.
</Tip>

## Switch to Case Mode

Case Mode lets you work with patient-specific data. Switch from Agent Mode to Case Mode using the toggle in the top-right corner.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Case Mode">
    Click **Case Mode** in the top-right corner of the interface.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View your cases">
    You'll see a list of your existing patient cases sorted by recent activity. Use the search bar to find specific cases.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create a new case

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click + New Case">
    In Case Mode, click the **+ New Case** button to open the case creation dialog.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in case details">
    Complete the required fields:

    | Field | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Case Name** | Identifier for the case (e.g., "Patient_12345") |
    | **Case Type** | Single Inherited Disease (Family and Somatic coming soon) |
    | **Consanguinity** | Whether the patient has consanguineous parents |
    | **Sex** | Patient biological sex |
    | **Date of Birth** | Patient DOB |
    | **Ethnicity** | Patient ethnicity for allele frequency context |
    | **Secondary Findings** | Opt-in to report incidental findings in medically actionable genes |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add sample information">
    Enter order number, collection and received dates, specimen type, ordering physician, and ordering institution.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload genomic data">
    Upload a VCF (Variant Call Format) file containing the patient's genomic variants. Drag and drop or click **Upload VCF** to select your file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the case">
    Click **Create** to save the case. Purna processes your VCF file and prepares the case for analysis.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Explore case tabs

Once you've opened a case, navigate between six tabs:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Overview" icon="layout-grid" href="/guides/case-overview">
    Dashboard with pathogenicity distribution, variant location, read depth charts, and findings summary.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Findings" icon="search" href="/guides/findings">
    Curated variants of interest categorized as Primary, Causal, Secondary, or Incidental.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Phenotypes" icon="tag" href="/guides/phenotypes">
    Manage HPO phenotypes with AI Assist or manual search.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Variants" icon="dna" href="/guides/variant-analysis">
    Browse and filter variants in cards or table view with gene panels and phenotype filters.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Access" icon="lock" href="/guides/cases#access-tab">
    Control who can view and edit this case within your organization.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Settings" icon="gear" href="/guides/case-settings">
    Rename, upload files, view audit log, and archive the case.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Ask contextual questions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a case from the chat">
    In the chat input area, click the **Cases** dropdown and select the patient case you want to ask about.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask case-specific questions">
    Your queries are now scoped to that patient's data. Examples:

    - "What are the top pathogenic variants in this patient?"
    - "Find loss-of-function variants in BRCA1"
    - "Which variants have ClinVar pathogenic classifications?"
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
You can switch between cases at any time by changing the Cases dropdown selection. Your chat history persists across cases.
</Note>
