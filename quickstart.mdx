Get up and running with Nexus in just a few minutes. You'll learn how to sign in, explore Agent Mode for genomics queries, and switch to Case Mode for patient case management.

## Sign in to Nexus

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Nexus">
    Navigate to **mip.purna.ai** in your web browser.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign in">
    Enter your Purna Biotech credentials. If you don't have an account, contact your organization administrator.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View the home screen">
    After signing in, you'll see the Nexus home screen with the greeting "Hello there! How can I help you today?"

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Start chatting in Agent Mode

Agent Mode is your entry point to Nexus. Use natural language to ask questions about genes, variants, diseases, and clinical implications.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a suggested prompt">
    The home screen offers helpful starting points. Click any suggestion to begin:
    
    - "Find pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes"
    - "What are the clinical implications of a VUS in TP53?"
    - Or browse other suggested prompts relevant to your interests
  </Step>
  <Step title="Or ask your own question">
    Click in the chat input box and type your genomics question. For example:
    
    - "Which genes are associated with hereditary breast cancer?"
    - "What does the OMIM database say about p.Val397Met in EGFR?"
    - "Find all pathogenic variants in genes related to cardiomyopathy"
  </Step>
  <Step title="View the response">
    Nexus analyzes your question and returns evidence-based answers with citations from genomic databases. You can continue the conversation by asking follow-up questions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
You can ask Nexus complex, multi-part questions. The AI understands genomics terminology and context, so natural language queries work best.
</Tip>

## Switch to Case Mode

Case Mode lets you work with patient-specific data. Switch from Agent Mode to Case Mode using the toggle in the top-right corner.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Case Mode">
    In the top-right corner of the Nexus interface, toggle from **Agent Mode** to **Case Mode**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View your cases">
    You'll now see a list of your existing patient cases. If you're new to Nexus, the list will be empty.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create a new case

Follow these steps to add your first patient case to Nexus:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Create New Case">
    In Case Mode, select the button to create a new case. A dialog will open with the case creation form.
    
    ![New case dialog](/images/guides/new-case.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in case details">
    Complete the following fields:
    
    | Field | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Case Name** | Identifier for the case (e.g., "Patient A - 2024") |
    | **Case Type** | Single Inherited Disease (Somatic and Family coming soon) |
    | **Consanguinity** | Whether the patient has consanguineous parents |
    | **Sex** | Patient biological sex |
    | **Date of Birth** | Patient DOB for age calculation |
    | **Ethnicity** | Patient ethnicity for allele frequency context |
    | **Secondary Findings** | Opt-in to identify clinically actionable genes beyond your primary indication |
    | **Order Details** | Additional clinical context or lab requisition info |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload genomic data">
    Upload a VCF (Variant Call Format) file containing the patient's genomic variants. This file is the foundation for case analysis.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the case">
    Click **Create** to save the case. Nexus processes your VCF file and prepares the case for analysis.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Explore case tabs

Once you've created or selected a case, you can explore the structured case workspace:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Overview" icon="layout-grid">
    View case summary with charts and statistics about the patient's variants and phenotypes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Findings" icon="search">
    Review prioritized findings and interpretations from the genomic analysis.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Phenotypes" icon="tag">
    Manage the patient's clinical phenotypes to inform variant interpretation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Variants" icon="dna">
    Explore detailed variant data with classifications, evidence, and research context.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Access" icon="lock">
    Control who can view and edit this case within your organization.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Ask contextual questions

Once you're in a case, you can ask Nexus questions specific to that patient:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use the cases dropdown">
    At the bottom of the chat input, you'll see a **Cases** dropdown. Select the patient case you want to ask about.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask case-specific questions">
    Now your queries are in the context of the selected case. Examples:
    
    - "What are the top 3 pathogenic variants in this patient?"
    - "Are these phenotypes consistent with the findings?"
    - "Which variants have clinical significance according to ClinVar?"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Nexus delivers patient-specific answers">
    The AI uses both the patient's genomic data and the broader genomic databases to provide precise, contextual answers.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
You can toggle between different cases at any time by changing the **Cases** dropdown selection. Your chat history persists across cases.
</Note>
