This guide walks you through signing in, starting a conversation, and running your first variant search.

## Get started

<Steps>
<Step title="Sign in to Nexus">

Open Nexus in your browser. You can sign in with your credentials or continue as a guest to explore the interface.

<Tip>Guest accounts let you try Nexus immediately. Create a full account to save your work and access all features.</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Start a new chat">

Click **New chat** from the sidebar. This opens a conversation where you can ask Nexus anything about genomics, variants, or your patient data.

Try asking something like:

```
What genes are associated with hereditary breast cancer?
```

Nexus responds with referenced information pulled from genomic databases.

</Step>

<Step title="Select a case">

If you have patient cases loaded, select one from the sidebar under **Cases**. Once a case is active, Nexus can search and analyze the variants within that case.

```
Show me all pathogenic variants in BRCA1 for this patient.
```

</Step>

<Step title="Explore results">

Nexus returns results directly in the chat. You can:

- View variant tables with filters
- Generate charts and visualizations
- Create documents and reports
- Ask follow-up questions to refine your analysis

</Step>
