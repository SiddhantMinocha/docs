## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to know programming to use Nexus?">
    No. You can interact with Nexus entirely through natural language. However, if you're familiar with Python, you can ask Nexus to write and run custom scripts directly in your browser using Pyodide with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the difference between Agent Mode and Case Mode?">
    **Agent Mode** is a chat-first interface for general genomics questions and database searches — no patient context needed.

    **Case Mode** is for managing patient cases with variant data, phenotypes, and clinical findings. Toggle between modes using the buttons in the top-right corner.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What file format is required for uploading variants?">
    Nexus requires **VCF (Variant Call Format)** files. Upload during case creation by dragging and dropping or using the Upload VCF button.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens to my data?">
    Your data is securely stored. Conversations and case data are private by default. You control visibility with the lock icon for conversations and the Access tab for cases. Code execution runs in your browser via Pyodide — data never leaves your session.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Nexus without loading a patient case?">
    Yes. In Agent Mode you can search genomic databases, research genes and diseases, build gene panels, and generate visualizations — all without patient data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What genomic databases does Nexus search?">
    Nexus searches databases across five categories: Research Papers (PubMed, Nature, Cell, NEJM, Lancet, arXiv, bioRxiv), Clinical Evidence (ClinVar, ClinicalTrials, OMIM, ClinGen, Orphanet), Variant Databases (gnomAD, GWAS Catalog, dbSNP, VarSome, Franklin), Guidelines (ACMG, NCCN, UpToDate, CDC, WHO), and Drugs & Therapies (PharmGKB, DrugBank, FDA, ClinicalTrials). Toggle sources on/off with the Sources dropdown.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do gene panels work?">
    Gene panels are curated gene lists for targeted variant filtering. Create custom panels or search existing ones, then apply them from chat ("Find variants in my cardiomyopathy panel") or from the Virtual Panels filter in the Variants tab.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I share cases with my team?">
    Yes. In any case, go to the **Access** tab to add team members with Admin or General roles. Manage broader team settings from **Settings > Team**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the variant detail panel?">
    Click any variant in the variant browser to open a detail panel with seven tabs: Assessment (in silico predictions), Details (genomic location, HGVS, population frequencies), Research (ClinVar, PubMed, gene info), ACMG (classification criteria), gnomAD (population data browser), AI Analysis (AI-powered interpretation), and Notes (collaborative annotations).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does ACMG classification work?">
    The ACMG tab in the variant detail panel shows the 28 standard ACMG/AMP criteria. Use **AI Enhance** to have Nexus automatically evaluate criteria using ClinVar, PubMed, gnomAD, and functional data. Review suggestions, accept or reject individual criteria, and manually reclassify with **Reclassify**. All changes are tracked in the reclassification history.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What clinical reports can Nexus generate?">
    Five report types: variant interpretation, clinical findings, case summary, ACMG evidence, and variant comparison. Ask from chat (e.g., "Generate a case summary report") and Nexus creates the document in the artifacts panel for download.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are findings?">
    Findings are variants marked as clinically significant during analysis. Categorize each as Primary (explains phenotype), Causal (confirmed cause), Secondary (related but not primary), or Incidental (unrelated but actionable). View and export findings from the Findings tab.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are HPO phenotypes and how do I use them?">
    HPO (Human Phenotype Ontology) phenotypes describe a patient's clinical features. Add them via **AI Assist** (Nexus suggests terms from clinical descriptions) or **Search** (manual lookup). Phenotypes become powerful filters in the Variants tab as Primary or Secondary Phenotypes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is in the case Settings tab?">
    The Settings tab lets you rename the case, edit case details, upload and manage files, view the settings activity audit log, and archive the case from the Danger Zone section.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What chart types are available?">
    Pie/donut, bar, horizontal bar, line, and area charts. Describe the visualization you want in natural language and Nexus generates it. After generation, ask to adjust colors, labels, or chart type.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does code execution work?">
    Nexus runs Python in your browser through Pyodide. Available libraries: pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. Your data stays in your session and never leaves your machine.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why does a case take a moment to load?">
    Cases that haven't been accessed recently may be archived for performance. When you open one, Nexus retrieves and loads it. This is typically brief.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I export my analysis results?">
    Yes. Export findings from the Findings tab, generate clinical reports from chat, create spreadsheet artifacts (CSV), and save Python scripts. Reports appear as downloadable artifacts in the side panel.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What plans are available?">
    Three tiers: **Individual** ($50/month, 50 queries/day), **Pro** ($125/month, API access, background analysis), and **Team** ($999/month, unlimited queries, SSO, custom branding, unlimited members). Manage from Settings > Plan.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I customize how Nexus responds?">
    Go to **Settings > General > Personalization** and configure Base Style (Detailed/Concise), Tone (Professional/Casual), Characteristics (Balanced/Cautious/Confident), and Output Format (Structured/Conversational).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What case types does Nexus support?">
    Currently **Single Inherited Disease**. Family Inherited Disease and Somatic Case types are coming soon.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do citations work?">
    Responses include inline citation badges (ClinVar, NCBI, PubMed, etc.) that link directly to source records. Click any badge to verify the information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I invite team members?">
    Go to **Settings > Team** and click **Invite** to generate an invitation link. Share the link with your colleagues. They can create an account (if needed) and join your organization through the link.
