Before diving into features, here are the key concepts that make up the Nexus workflow.

## Chat

The chat is your primary interface for interacting with Nexus. You type questions or instructions in natural language, and Nexus responds with answers, data, visualizations, or actions.

Every conversation is saved automatically, so you can revisit past analyses at any time.

## Cases

A case represents a patient or sample. Each case contains a set of genetic variants that you can search, filter, and analyze. Selecting a case gives Nexus the context it needs to answer questions about that patient's data.

## Variants

Variants are the individual genetic changes found in a patient's sequencing data. Nexus lets you search variants by gene, pathogenicity, zygosity, allele frequency, consequence type, and more.

## Gene panels

A virtual gene panel is a curated list of genes associated with a specific disease or condition. You can create your own panels, use public panels, or let Nexus suggest panels based on a clinical question.

Panels work as filters — once you have a panel, you can apply it to a case to focus on the most relevant variants.

## Artifacts

Artifacts are documents that Nexus creates during a conversation. These can be:

- **Text documents** — summaries, reports, or notes
- **Code** — Python scripts for custom analysis
- **Spreadsheets** — tabular data exports

Artifacts appear in a side panel and are versioned, so you can track changes over time.

## AI tools

Nexus has access to a set of specialized tools that it uses automatically based on your questions:

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Variant search** | Finds variants in a patient case using filters |
| **Variant analytics** | Aggregates variant data for statistics and charts |
| **Panel search** | Looks up gene panels by disease or condition |
| **NCBI search** | Queries gene, SNP, ClinVar, OMIM, and PubMed databases |
| **Chart creation** | Generates pie, bar, line, and area charts |
| **Code execution** | Runs Python code with pandas and matplotlib |
| **Web search** | Searches the web for additional context |

You don't need to invoke these tools manually. Nexus decides which tools to use based on your question.
