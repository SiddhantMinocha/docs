Nexus is a clinical genomics AI assistant that helps you analyze genetic data and discover insights. Here are the fundamental concepts you need to know.

## Agent Mode and Case Mode

Toggle between two distinct modes using the buttons in the top-right corner:

**Agent Mode** is your chat-first interface for exploring general genomics questions, searching databases, and conducting research. You don't need patient data to use this mode. Your sidebar displays chat history organized by date.

**Case Mode** is your case management interface for working with patient data. Your sidebar shows your cases list where you can create, search, and manage individual cases.

## Chat

The chat interface is the primary way you interact with Nexus. Submit natural language queries and receive conversational responses with citations. All conversations are auto-saved and appear in the sidebar. Start a new chat using the **+** button.

## Cases

A case represents a patient or sample in your analysis. Each case contains genetic variants extracted from VCF files and is organized into six tabs:

- **Overview**: Dashboard with charts and key metrics
- **Findings**: Curated variants of interest from your analysis
- **Phenotypes**: HPO terms associated with the case
- **Variants**: Browsable and filterable variant data
- **Access**: Team permissions and sharing settings
- **Settings**: Case configuration, files, and audit log

Currently, Nexus supports Single Inherited Disease cases. Family Inherited Disease and Somatic Case types are coming soon.

## Variants

Variants are individual genetic changes identified during analysis. For each variant, Nexus displays:

- Gene name and consequence type (missense, frameshift, splice site, intron variant, etc.)
- Genomic position and HGVS notation
- Zygosity (homozygous or heterozygous)
- In silico predictions (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, AlphaMissense)
- Read depth and population allele frequency
- ClinVar classification
- Inheritance pattern and rsID
- Pathogenicity classification (Pathogenic, Likely Pathogenic, VUS, VUS/Conflicting, Likely Benign, Benign)

## Variant detail panel

Click any variant to open a detail panel with seven tabs of in-depth information:

- **Assessment**: Pathogenicity predictions from SIFT, PolyPhen-2, and AlphaMissense
- **Details**: Genomic location, HGVS nomenclature, allele frequencies, and conservation scores
- **Research**: ClinVar entries, PubMed literature, gene expression, and Phen2Gene data
- **ACMG**: ACMG/AMP classification criteria with AI-enhanced evidence review
- **gnomAD**: Population frequency data via the embedded gnomAD browser
- **AI Analysis**: AI-powered variant interpretation
- **Notes**: Collaborative notes with visibility control

## ACMG classification

Nexus supports ACMG/AMP variant classification with 28 standard criteria. The ACMG tab displays active criteria with evidence summaries. Use **AI Enhance** to automatically evaluate criteria using evidence from ClinVar, PubMed, gnomAD, and functional data. You can also manually reclassify variants and track classification history.

## Gene panels

Gene panels are virtual collections of curated gene lists used to filter variants. When you create a panel, you specify clinical intent, validation status, inheritance models, and variant types. Apply panels from the variant browser or from chat.

## Research sources

Control which databases Nexus searches using the **Sources** dropdown at the bottom of the chat. Toggle sources on and off across five categories:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Research Papers">
    PubMed, Nature, Cell, NEJM, Lancet, arXiv, bioRxiv
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Clinical Evidence">
    ClinVar, ClinicalTrials, OMIM, ClinGen, Orphanet
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Variant Databases">
    gnomAD, GWAS Catalog, dbSNP, VarSome, Franklin
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Guidelines">
    ACMG, NCCN, UpToDate, CDC, WHO
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Drugs & Therapies">
    PharmGKB, DrugBank, FDA, ClinicalTrials
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Findings

Findings are variants of interest marked during analysis. Categorize each finding as:

- **Primary**: Variant directly related to the patient's presenting phenotype
- **Causal**: Confirmed to cause the patient's condition
- **Secondary**: Related to the case but not the primary explanation
- **Incidental**: Clinically significant variant unrelated to the case phenotype

Each finding displays gene name, genomic position, pathogenicity badge, HGVS notation, zygosity, consequence type, and reviewer information.

## Phenotypes

Phenotypes are HPO (Human Phenotype Ontology) terms associated with your case. Add phenotypes through **AI Assist** (Nexus suggests terms based on clinical descriptions) or by manually searching by name or HPO ID. Use phenotypes as Primary or Secondary filters during variant analysis.

## Clinical reports

Nexus generates structured clinical reports from your analysis data. Five report types are available: variant interpretation, clinical findings, case summary, ACMG evidence, and variant comparison. Reports include headings, tables, charts, and callout sections.

## Artifacts

Artifacts are documents Nexus creates during conversations:

- **Text documents**: Clinical summaries, reports, and analysis narratives
- **Code files**: Python scripts for custom analysis
- **Spreadsheets**: CSV exports of variant data and findings

Artifacts appear in a side panel with version history so you can track changes.

## AI tools

Nexus automatically uses a suite of tools to assist your analysis:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| Variant search | Finds variants in a patient case using your specified filters |
| Variant analytics | Aggregates variant data for statistics and charts |
| Panel search | Looks up gene panels by disease or clinical condition |
| NCBI search | Queries gene, SNP, ClinVar, OMIM, and PubMed databases |
| Chart creation | Generates pie, bar, line, and area charts from your data |
| Code execution | Runs Python code with pandas and matplotlib |
| Clinical reports | Generates structured clinical documentation |
| Web search | Searches the web for additional context |

## Citations

Responses include inline citation badges linking to original sources. Badges are color-coded by database (ClinVar, NCBI, PubMed, etc.) and are clickable to open the source record directly.
