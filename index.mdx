Purna is a unified research environment for biology. It brings together AI, curated databases, and powerful compute into a single platform — so you can go from raw sequencing data to meaningful insights without switching between tools.

Ask questions in natural language. Upload your data. Run custom analyses. Generate reports. Everything happens in one place.
